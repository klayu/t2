# Leveraging passive income to create an aggressive retirement

Retirement today looks much different than it did decades ago. With increasing life expectancies, many people running hobbies as businesses, and the rise of peer-to-peer investing, there are many options to consider on how to fund and support a retirement. Here we will discuss how passive income can be leveraged to create an aggressive retirement, no matter your financial position.

## What is passive income?

Passive income is income that is earned regularly with minimal effort from an individual after the initial work to generate the source of income is completed. This could involve stocks, real estate, and business investments. As opposed to earned income, passive income requires fewer hours of maintenance per week and is not tied to a traditional career.

## How does passive income create an aggressive retirement?

Passive income can create an aggressive retirement by providing a reliable income stream when traditional earned income ends, like when you retire. With the right strategies, passive income can be leveraged to build a nest egg fast and be able to support a strong, cushioned retirement.

The key is to invest and reinvest your income into multiple passive income streams. This can include becoming a real estate investor, starting a business and leveraging technology, or investing in the stock market. Taking time to create a diversified investment portfolio and learning about the available passive income options is integral to ensure you have a reliable income later in life.

## How to get started

Getting started on building an aggressive retirement starts with researching and testing your passive income streams. As you review and compare the different options, like digital investments, stocks and business investments, create parameters that work for you.

Once you have an idea of the type of passive income investment options that work for you, start with researching the different investments. Check if they are regulated, what type of returns they offer and what types of risks they might include. 

Finally, as you progress, and build up your investments, review them at regular intervals and consider new ones. Continuous learning and keeping up with your options is a crucial part of creating an aggressive retirement.

## Conclusion

Creating an aggressive retirement is possible with the right amount of planning and effort invested into passive sources of income. With careful research, understanding the different types of income options and regular updates, you can design and tweak retirement plans that fit your needs and goals.
