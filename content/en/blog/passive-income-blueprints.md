<!-- # A Blueprint to Consistently Create Passive Income  -->

Passive income is an income stream derived from an investment that requires little to no work to maintain. It’s a great way to diversify your income and pursue financial freedom. Here you will find a series of steps to create your very own passive income system. 

## Create a Plan

Set a realistic but also ambitious goal for yourself. Then create a list of steps to get there. Figure out how much you need to save, where you can invest, and what kind of returns you need to meet your goal.

## Research Your Investment Options

Look into the different investment options available and decide which option works best for you. Evaluate the risks and rewards of each option. Some good places to start are stocks, bonds, real estate, and cryptocurrency.

## Determine Your Investment Amount

Calculate how much money you need to invest each month in order to reach your goal.  This will also influence what kind of investments you make. For example, you may have to invest less in stocks and more in real estate if you are investing more in total. 

## Build a Diversified Portfolio

Make sure you diversify your investments. It’s a good practice to spread your investments among different assets. This will help you manage risk and protect your portfolio from volatile markets.

## Set Up Automated Investing

Set up automated investing to help you save and invest without thinking too much about it. Pick a broker to manage your investments and ask them to set up auto deposit and auto investing. This way, you’ll be investing your money consistently and won’t have to worry about it. 

## Track Your Progress 

Check in regularly to make sure that you are on track and make adjustments if needed. This will help you stay on top of your goal and avoid becoming overwhelmed or discouraged. 

## Create Adequate Cash Reserves 

Make sure that you have enough reserve cash to cover any unexpected expenses. This will make sure you don’t have to tap into your investments if an emergency arises. 

By following these steps, you’ll be well on your way to creating a passive income stream that you can rely on for years to come. Good luck!
