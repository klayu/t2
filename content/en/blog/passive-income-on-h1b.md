Living and working in the United States on an H1B Visa can be a great opportunity for professional growth, but there are some restrictions when it comes to generating passive income. Here are some creative ideas that can help you generate passive income while on an H1B Visa. 

## EASY & LOW RISK : Get 1000$/year or 83$ every month using the right Credit Card.

Cashback credit cards are a type of credit card that offers cashback rewards for using the card. This means that you can earn a percentage of your purchase back in cash. The amount of cashback you can earn will vary depending on the credit card and the purchase category, but it's typically between 1-5% of your total purchase amount.


Have a look at my in depth analysis that shows that an average family can earn upto $1000 in cold hard cash every year.

## Quick Sidenote : Keeping your Parents Safe as a Immigrant on H1B

As a Immigrant, me and my spouse left our home country to settle in US.

For the longest time, I wished for a service that would call my parents on my behalf and just ask them if they were all fine. Yes, I could Whatsapp them, but sometimes we all forget. 

ðŸ‘‰ So I built [DadsCall.com](https://www.DadsCall.com/) 

DadsCall.com is a innovative online service designed to make calls to your loved ones living remotely and ensuring they are safe. It literally takes 5 mins to setup and the service will call your parents every day, rain or shine.

If you see value in this blog and would like to support us, please give our service a try. [DadsCall.com](https://www.DadsCall.com/), I have a free plan there, and the paid plan  - that calls your parents every day - is also not very expensive.

Lets continue making more passive income, shall we.

## EASY & LOW RISK : Get 450$/year or 37$/month by keeping your money with US Treasry Department for 1 month.

**First, some basics :**

T-bills, T-notes, and T-bonds are different types of U.S. Treasury securities with varying maturities and characteristics. This of these as "Fixed Deposit" or "Certificates of Deposits" with US Fedral Government.

**Treasury Bills (T-bills):** T-bills are short-term debt securities with a maturity of one year or less. They are issued at a discount to their face value and do not pay periodic interest payments. Instead, investors earn interest by buying T-bills at a discount and receiving the full face value upon maturity. T-bills are considered one of the safest investments because they are backed by the U.S. government.

**Treasury Notes (T-notes):** T-notes have longer maturities than T-bills, ranging from 2 to 10 years. They pay interest semi-annually, and the principal is repaid at maturity. T-notes are issued with a fixed interest rate determined at auction. They are considered medium-term investments and provide investors with a predictable stream of income.

**Treasury Bonds (T-bonds):** T-bonds have the longest maturities among Treasury securities, typically ranging from 10 to 30 years. Like T-notes, they pay interest semi-annually. T-bonds also have a fixed interest rate determined at auction. They provide investors with long-term income and are often used to fund government projects and initiatives.

Both T-notes and T-bonds are known as coupon securities because they make regular interest payments (known as coupon payments) to investors. Upon maturity, the principal amount of both T-notes and T-bonds is repaid. Both T-notes and T-bonds are considered relatively safe investments, backed by the U.S. government.

The U.S. Treasury Department conducts regular auctions to issue new T-notes and T-bonds, and investors can buy and sell them on the secondary market through brokers and financial institutions.


Now you know, these three terms, I want you to start by dipping your toes gentley by buying a 30 day T-Bill for a small amount. Say 10,000$. 

**Follow these steps :**

Investing in treasury bills is straightforward. You can invest in them directly through the TreasuryDirect.gov website, or you can buy them through a broker like Fidelity or Vanguard. Here are the steps to invest in T-bills:

**1. Open a TreasuryDirect account**: If you want to invest directly in T-bills, you need to open a TreasuryDirect account. The process is simple and can be done online. Open it here [TreasuryDirect.gov](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/) 

**2. Fund your account**: Once your account is open, you need to fund it. You can do this through a bank transfer, a payroll deduction, or a check.

**3. Buy T-bills**: Once your account is funded, you can buy T-bills through the TreasuryDirect website. You can choose the maturity date and the amount you want to invest.

**4. Receive interest payments**: When the T-bill matures, you will receive the face value of the bill plus the interest earned.

TOTAL SAVED A MONTH : 83$ + 37$ = 120$
