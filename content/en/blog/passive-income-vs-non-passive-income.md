<!-- # Passive Income vs. Non-Passive Income -->

When it comes to generating a consistent income, there are two types of income sources to consider â€“ passive income and non-passive income. Understanding their differences can help you decide which income source to pursue. 

## Passive Income

Passive income is earned from investments that require very little effort to maintain. Generally, the income is generated regardless of whether the investor puts in a certain amount of time or effort. Examples of passive income include:

* Dividends from investment in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds
* Interest from savings accounts and certificates of deposits (CDs)
* Rental income 
* Royalties from books, products, music, etc.
* Interest from loans given to others
* Income from business activities in which the investor is not actively involved 

## Non-Passive Income

Non-passive income is earned from investments that require time and effort to maintain. Examples of non-passive income include: 

* Wages from a job
* Income from businesses in which the investor is actively involved 
* Income from real estate investments 
* Profits from a side business

Both passive and non-passive income can be used to supplement or replace wages and salaries. Doing research to decide which type of income is right for you is a great way to start your journey to financial freedom.
